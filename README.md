Hey everyone.


I'm mentoring a ton of people new to people management and leadership positions.

I personally mentally model people management and team building as isolating individuals with their unique skills and interests - so that, like RPG video games, when building a team you're building a party.

I'm imagining a repository of skills, archetypes, and posts describing how they play together

Let's see if it works.
